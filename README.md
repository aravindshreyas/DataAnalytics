# Data Science and Analytics
This repo contains all the exploratory data analysis and data science I've performed using Python and Tableau. It gives great insights of trends in a variety of datasets, do check it out!
NOTE: I've committed the tableau workbooks so as to be able to view interactive graphs and analysis. Where the graphs werw not interactive, the pdf of the graphs have been uploaded.
