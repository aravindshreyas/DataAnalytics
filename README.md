# Data Science and Analytics
This repo contains all the exploratory data analysis and data science I've performed using Python and Tableau. It gives great insights of trends in a variety of datasets, do check it out!

NOTE: I've committed the .twb files so as to be able to view interactive graphs and analyses. Where the graphs were not interactive, the pdf format of the graphs have been uploaded. Hence I highly recommend you to download tableau and download the twb files to view my work on Tableau.
